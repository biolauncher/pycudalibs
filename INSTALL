1. Check/edit setup.py for local paths to numpy and CUDA 
   assumes python is on path and properly configured.
2. python setup.py build
3. python setup.py install (assuming 2 did not report any errors)
4. cd test; python test_all.py
___
N.B. test_math requires scipy.linalg
if all that works ok then you are probably good to go...
