I am releasing this code under LGPL3 - see copyright.txt, COPYING, COPYING.LESSER

This branch has been made to see if we can easily integrate the CULA
LAPACK libraries and leverage the performance improvements to CULA
BLAS implementations.  CULA is proprietary (though very reasonbly
priced for research) and there is free version with single
precision functions. See: http://www.culatools.com/

Synopsis:
import cunumpy as cn
 
Tested on:
OS X 10.5.*, CUDA 2.0-1 and Python 2.5-6
OS X 10.6.*, CUDA 4.0   and Python 2.7.1
